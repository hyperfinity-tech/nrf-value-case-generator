    "executiveSummary": "This value case estimates Adidas’s annual gross margin uplift potential from three levers: more personalised loyalty, supplier-funded loyalty activity and improved price/markdown optimisation. We start from Adidas’s 2024 net sales of around €23.7bn and gross margin of 50.8%, converting to approximately $26.1bn net sales and $13.2bn gross profit.[2][4] Using disclosed adiClub membership scale (303m members) and sportswear benchmarks, we estimate around 55% of sales from loyalty members and define the revenue subsets that each lever can realistically influence.[3][16] For each lever we apply evidence-based uplift ranges derived from fashion and sports retail case studies and then calculate the midpoint impact on addressable gross margin. The midpoint base case yields roughly $450m GM uplift, below the $2m threshold, so the Smart Scalable Outreach Framework requires moving to stretch-up values for all levers, still within credible bounds. This produces a stretch-up value case of around $548m incremental gross margin annually. Strategically, this matters because Adidas is exiting a turnaround phase with strong brand momentum and rising margins; now is the time to lock in structurally higher profitability by deepening loyalty personalisation, harnessing partner funding and tightening price discipline.[2][4][5][6][15][16]",
