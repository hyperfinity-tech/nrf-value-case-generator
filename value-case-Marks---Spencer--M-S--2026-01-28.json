We anchor total revenue at £13.8168bn for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2025 [1] and convert uplifts to GM using a blended 36% GM proxy [2]. Recent disruption created heightened markdown/waste and stock impacts [8], reinforcing the urgency of stronger pricing and allocation controls. Sparks benefits (personalised offers and birthday treats) are clearly positioned [3] and were reinstated following the April 2025 cyber incident [4], but sentiment is mixed with recurring complaints about inconsistent value and app reliability [9][14]. The BASE CASE using midpoint uplifts is £2.7m GM, above the £2m threshold; therefore, the model uses MIDPOINT values across levers, resulting in an estimated £22.7m GM uplift. Strategically, this builds resilience by reducing discount leakage, improving funded value, and tightening markdown discipline during a period of heightened operational scrutiny.",
