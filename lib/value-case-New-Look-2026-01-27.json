We first estimate loyalty-linked sales using New Look’s FY25 revenue of £687.7m [2][3], then apply conservative, evidence-bounded uplifts to the most relevant revenue pools and convert to GM using the blended margin of 48.1% [2][3]. Club New Look launched nationally on 27 October 2025 with a 25% welcome offer and ongoing ‘Club Prices’, after a soft launch that reached 500,000 sign-ups and a stated target of 800,000 members [1][7]. With discounting pressure explicitly cited in FY25 [2][3], tightening price architecture and markdown rules is a timely GM lever. Because the base case using midpoint uplifts clears the £2m GM threshold, we keep median (not stretch) assumptions across all levers to avoid best-case dependency and maintain CFO-grade conservatism.",

The best available last-12-month sentiment signal comes from high-volume customer feedback on New Look’s digital experience (delivery, returns, customer service), which is highly relevant to loyalty enrolment, engagement and repeat purchasing. Sentiment is mixed: customers still highlight finding value and ‘bargains’, but negative themes dominate around refund delays, difficulty contacting a human, and frustration with automated chat/support. This feedback is primarily from general customers rather than confirmed loyalty members, but it indicates the friction points that can suppress loyalty adoption and reduce the realised value of Club New Look if not addressed alongside personalisation and offer strategy.",
