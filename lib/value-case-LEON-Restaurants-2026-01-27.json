[1] We first modelled a midpoint-based base case across levers; because the base case total was below £2.0m GM, we applied the stretch-up rule uniformly across levers (still within evidence-backed ranges). For personalised loyalty, we apply an 18% uplift within McKinsey’s cited 5–25% credible span for personalisation impact. [9] For price optimisation, we apply a conservative 1.7% uplift on total revenue, anchored to a 0.5–2.0% credible proxy range. [10] Strategically, this matters now: LEON’s administration status and challenging trading context increase the urgency of shifting demand to higher-margin, lower-waste repeat behaviour while tightening price architecture to protect margin.
