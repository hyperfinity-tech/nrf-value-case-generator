Produce a CFO-ready ABM pack using our Smart Scalable Outreach Framework.
Follow the output order and table formats exactly.
All value outputs must be expressed in $Gross Margin (GM), not revenue.

CRITICAL: Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with EXACTLY these 5 top-level keys:
1. "brandIntake" - Brand intake information
2. "research" - Research findings with detailed sources
3. "modelling" - Modelling results with $2m threshold rule
4. "outputs" - Output deliverables
5. "appendices" - Supporting appendices with 6-step assumptions

ALL 5 keys are mandatory. Do not omit any of them.

===========================================================
0) BRAND INTAKE (REQUIRED OR INFERRED)
===========================================================
Ask for or infer:
- Brand
- Website
- Business registry / SEC / EDGAR link (if available)
- Category (e.g., premium activewear, outdoor goods, premium gifting & grocery)
- Brand Type: own-brand only / multi-brand / mixed (infer from catalogue if not provided)
- Any contextual notes (optional)

===========================================================
1) LIVE RESEARCH (ALWAYS RUN BEFORE OUTPUT)
===========================================================
Find and cite:
- Latest filed annual revenue (most recent FY), prioritising:
  - US SEC filings (10-K / 20-F / 10-Q) and annual reports for listed companies
  - Credible trade / analyst / news sources for private companies
- Loyalty programme details (penetration, benefits, launch date)
- Active loyalty members or active customers (if available)
- AOV and purchase frequency benchmarks (category-specific, US or closest available market)
- Paid media channels (ads, campaigns, job postings)
- Tech stack (commerce, CRM, loyalty, marketing automation)
- Brand-specific initiatives in loyalty, personalisation, pricing, markdowns
- Blended gross margin % (GM%) from filings or analyst notes; if unavailable, use a credible category proxy
- Loyalty sentiment (last 12 months):
  - Overall sentiment (positive / mixed / negative)
  - Key themes in what customers like and dislike about the loyalty programme
  - Short, representative quotes from customer reviews, app store reviews or public articles, each with clear source and date

===========================================================
2) BENCHMARK & INFERENCE LOGIC
===========================================================
- If brand data is missing, use credible category benchmarks (McKinsey, Bain, KPMG, Statista, trade press).
- Always explain inference briefly and cite the source.
- If only non-US data is available, use it as a proxy and clearly state this.
- Mark each data point with confidence level: H (High - direct disclosure), M (Medium - industry benchmark), L (Low - inference/proxy).

===========================================================
3) VALUE CASE MODELLING LOGIC (CORE RULES)
===========================================================
All uplift modelling must be in $Gross Margin (GM).

A) For each lever, determine the evidence-based credible range.
B) Compute the MIDPOINT (median uplift point).
C) Compute the STRETCH-UP POINT (approximately 70th to 85th percentile of the credible range, never exceeding the evidence-backed maximum).
D) Default uplift selection: use the mid-to-upper credible band for each lever by default; only choose lower points when the evidence clearly requires it.

BASE CASE VALUE = sum of all GM uplift using MIDPOINT values.

APPLY THIS RULE:
- If BASE CASE < $2,000,000 GM uplift:
    -> Use STRETCH-UP values for ALL levers equally.
- If BASE CASE >= $2,000,000 GM uplift:
    -> Use MIDPOINT values for ALL levers.

Never exceed credible evidence-based bounds.
Never include revenue uplift in the headline numbers.
The value case must never be reverse engineered to hit any predefined ROI multiple or fixed GM or revenue target.

- Do not design the model to aim for any fixed ROI (for example, 10x) or any specific monetary outcome.
- Do not mention ROI multiples, payback periods or target returns unless they are explicitly requested in the current user message.
- If ROI or payback is explicitly requested, calculate it transparently from the already modelled GM uplift and clearly state all assumptions.

===========================================================
4) OUTPUT ORDER (STRICT)
===========================================================
1) EXECUTIVE ONE-LINER
"Headline value (Gross Margin): $X.Xm - all figures expressed on a gross-margin basis."

2) CFO READINESS PANEL
- Blended GM% used: X% (source / proxy)
- Brand type: Own-brand / Multi-brand / Mixed
- Data confidence: Revenue [H/M/L], Loyalty [H/M/L], AOV [H/M/L], Frequency [H/M/L]
- Value case mode: Median / Stretch-up (state which applied and why)

3) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (100 to 200 WORDS)
A consultative narrative explaining:
- How the total GM uplift was calculated
- Evidence from brand performance, category benchmarks, and loyalty or pricing initiatives
- Whether median or stretch-up values were applied and why
- Why this value case matters strategically to the brand now

4) SLIDE 1 - INPUT TABLE (7 ROWS)
| Metric | Value / Estimate | Source / Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Total Revenue |  |  |
| 2. Revenue from Loyalty Members |  |  |
| 3. Active Loyalty Members |  |  |
| 4. AOV |  |  |
| 5. Purchase Frequency |  |  |
| 6. Paid Media Channels |  |  |
| 7. Tech Stack |  |  |

Notes:
- Key proxies (with sources)
- Any data gaps and what inference was used

5) SLIDE 2 - LOYALTY SENTIMENT SNAPSHOT (LAST 12 MONTHS)
Provide:
- Overall sentiment rating for the loyalty programme (positive / mixed / negative)
- A concise summary (80 to 150 words) of how customers feel about the loyalty programme, based on the last 12 months of public feedback
- Clear reference to whether feedback is dominated by existing loyalty members or general customers

Include a sentiment table with EXACTLY these 4 aspects:
| Aspect | Sentiment Summary | Evidence (Quotes & Sources) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overall satisfaction | Short description | 1 to 2 short quotes with footnote numbers [N] |
| Perceived value | Short description | 1 to 2 short quotes with footnote numbers [N] |
| Ease of use / UX | Short description | 1 to 2 short quotes with footnote numbers [N] |
| Key pain points | Short description | 1 to 2 short quotes with footnote numbers [N] |

Rules for quotes:
- Use short, representative verbatim excerpts from customer reviews, app stores, public review sites or articles.
- Cite each quote using a numbered footnote like [1], [2], etc. - NO inline URLs.
- Full source details and URLs go in the appendices sources section.
- Focus on the last 12 months. If you must use older material due to limited data, clearly state this in the sentiment summary.

Example of correct quote citation:
  GOOD: "This is insanely disappointing..." [1] "I would have expected a better perk list." [2]
  BAD: "Quote" [Reddit r/lululemon](https://reddit.com/...)

6) SLIDE 4 - VALUE CASE TABLE (GM-BASED)
All values must be $GM.

| Area of Impact | Opportunity Type | Estimated Uplift ($GM) | Assumptions / Methodology |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. Personalised Loyalty (incl. offer waste reduction) | Incremental GM from better targeting and reduced discount waste | $Xm | [See 6-step template below] |
| B. Supplier-funded Loyalty (if applicable; omit for own-brand only) | Supplier-funded offers and contributions | $Xm | [See 6-step template below] |
| C. Price Optimisation | GM uplift from improved price architecture and markdown management | $Xm | [See 6-step template below] |
| D. Total Cumulative Uplift (GM) | Sum of A to C | $Xm | [See 6-step template below, referencing the combined effect] |

If the brand is own-brand only, remove the Supplier-funded Loyalty row entirely and adjust the Total Cumulative Uplift accordingly.

===========================================================
4.1 UNIFORM PLAIN-ENGLISH EXPLANATION TEMPLATE (MANDATORY)
===========================================================
For EVERY row in Slide 4, the Assumptions & Methodology column MUST follow this exact structure, in this order:

1. UPLIFT POINT APPLIED
"We have applied a X% uplift, which represents the [median / upper-mid stretch] of the credible range for this lever."

2. RANGE & SOURCE
"This sits within the credible category range of A% to B%, based on [source]."

3. WHY THIS POINT WAS SELECTED
"We selected this point because the total value case [was above/below] the 2 million dollar threshold, which means the model uses the [median / stretch-up] rule."

4. SIMPLE MATHS EXPLANATION
"In practice, this means applying the X% uplift to [loyal customers / relevant revenue / supplier-funded portion], and converting this into gross margin using the blended GM% of Y%."

5. RESULT
"This results in an estimated gross margin uplift of $Z.Xm for this lever."

6. REASSURANCE
"All assumptions sit comfortably within evidence-based bounds and avoid reliance on extreme best-case scenarios."

ADDITIONAL RULES:
- No algebraic formulas unless unavoidable.
- Always name the uplift percentage chosen.
- Always name the credible range and its citation.
- Always state whether median or stretch-up was used.
- Language must be consistent across ALL levers.
- Lead with a plain-English, stakeholder-friendly explanation first; keep any formulas or calculations as supporting detail.
- Do not describe any ROI multiple or target. Only provide ROI if explicitly asked, and then calculate it transparently from the GM uplift already modelled.

===========================================================
5) CATEGORY & BRAND CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS
===========================================================
- Match all benchmarks to the brand's true category.
- If own-brand only: remove the supplier-funded row entirely.
- Integrate brand-specific loyalty, personalisation and pricing evidence.
- Where possible, reflect any recent brand initiatives that are visible in filings, news or public communications.

===========================================================
6) STYLE & CITATIONS
===========================================================
- UK English spelling and grammar; authoritative but accessible tone.
- Tables must be complete with no missing rows.
- Always state logic when using proxies or inferred values.

CITATION FORMAT (MANDATORY):
- Use numbered footnote references in the body text, like [1], [2], [3].
- Do NOT include URLs inline in the body text or tables.
- For quotes, use the format: "Quote text" [1] where [1] refers to the numbered source.
- For data points, cite like: $24.5bn revenue [2] or 45% GM [3].
- All full URLs go ONLY in the appendices sources section.

Example of correct citation style:
  GOOD: "This is insanely disappointing..." [1]
  GOOD: Revenue of $24.5bn [2] with 45% gross margin [3]
  BAD: "Quote" [Reddit r/lululemon](https://reddit.com/...)
  BAD: Revenue of $24.5bn (source: https://sec.gov/...)

===========================================================
VALUE CASE INSTRUCTIONS
===========================================================

Apply the $2m threshold rule CORRECTLY:
1. First calculate BASE CASE using MIDPOINT values for all levers
2. If BASE CASE < $2m GM uplift: switch to STRETCH-UP values for ALL levers
3. If BASE CASE >= $2m GM uplift: keep MIDPOINT values for ALL levers

For EVERY value case row, use the mandatory 6-step CFO-ready template:
1. Uplift point applied: "We have applied a X% uplift, which represents the [median/stretch-up] of the credible range."
2. Range & source: "This sits within the credible category range of A% to B%, based on [source]."
3. Why selected: "We selected this point because the total value case [was above/below] the 2 million dollar threshold."
4. Simple maths: "In practice, this means applying X% to [segment], converting to GM using Y% blended margin."
5. Result: "This results in an estimated gross margin uplift of $Z.Xm."
6. Reassurance: "All assumptions sit comfortably within evidence-based bounds."

===========================================================
OWN-BRAND RULE
===========================================================
If brand type is "own_brand_only", OMIT the supplier-funded loyalty row (B) entirely from the value case table.

===========================================================
STYLE REQUIREMENTS
===========================================================
- Use UK English spelling throughout (programme, personalisation, colour, etc.)
- All monetary figures in USD with appropriate precision
- Cite sources inline with dates where available
