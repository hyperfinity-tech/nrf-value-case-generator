# Project Explainer Plan

- **Audience**: Developers and PMs needing oversight on the work in this repo.
- **Goals**: Provide a concise, high-level explainer (no timelines) covering purpose, architecture, key flows, configuration, and how to run/deploy.
- **Scope**:
  - Project purpose and scope.
  - Architecture: frontend, backend APIs, prompts/data.
  - Key flows: chat and ABM pack generation.
  - Configuration/env and important files.
  - Local run and deployment notes.
  - Current WIP, limitations, risks.
- **Sources to scan**: README (if present), `package.json`, main app routes/components (`components/abm-page-client.tsx`, `app/(chat)/api/abm-pack/route.ts`, `app/(chat)/api/abm-pack/schema.ts`), prompt/config files (e.g., `lib/prompts/meta-image-prompt.ts`), sample data JSONs, and any existing docs.
- **Deliverable**: `PROJECT_EXPLAINER.md` at the repo root.
- **Workflow**:
  1) Review the above sources to collect facts.
  2) Draft the explainer per the scope.
  3) Share the draft for review and adjust as needed.
